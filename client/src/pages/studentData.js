I was a middle school teacher for almost 10 years when I decided that the stress and pay wasn‚Äôt worth the toll on my mental health so I decided to roam the wilderness looking for a new career path. During this time of wandering, I was abducted by the Weapon X program. They fused pure JavaScript to my skeleton which obviously gave me superpowers. I then enrolled in boot camp and finished in February. Raj and Maria said I should use my powers as a TA. I also like to play tennis, disc golf, and video games.",

Before this course I was completely new to coding so it was definitely a challenge. I am excited for what the future brings! I am hoping to make enough $ down the road with coding that I can pursue what makes me happy part time which is museum work.",

I honestly just wanted to do front end web design where I could be creative and make things look good. I signed up for the wrong bootcamp and almost dropped more times than I can count but I have actually really gotten into back-end and now I'm happy I stuck it out and can create the full app instead of being limited on what I can do.",

Starting with Arduino and their version of C++ and then RaspberryPi introduced me to Linux and the awesomeness that is Python. With Python I've built various projects from a TwitterBot using APIs to a Brute Force program for hacking open ports on Shodan.io, and it even worked a few times! I fill most of my free time with work and I do get down on some Battlefield4. I joined the bootcamp to fast track the learning process and to truly understand bringing an application to market. I'm much more interested in gaining the knowledge then I am seeking employment.",

And the same week that classes started, I also was able to transfer over to a web developer position at my current company (where I was an HR assistant for a year.) I also play video games. I have a PS4 and a PC. Lately I‚Äôve just been playing Overwatch. I‚Äôve always been interested in computers. Logical stuff like coding has always been right up my alley. Like, I loved calculus for example. I knew I always wanted to get into STEM. One of my best friends, Max, started teaching himself how to code in C++ back in 2017 and showed me some of what he was doing. He recommended a class to me, I took it. And I absolutely loved it. (I cried a little bit a few times) but other than that, I loved every second of it. I didn‚Äôt study much after that thanks to imposter syndrome. But with the cost of things rising and HR making me feel burnt out and unmotivated, I knew it was time for me to change career paths. One of the web devs at my work told me about bootcamps and now here I am!"
